Difference between document and object model:


1. Document Object:
	The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.
- It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
- It is loaded inside the window.
- It is the object of window property.
- All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
- We can access the document from a window using the window. document.
- The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model).
- Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title
- example: document.title :  will return the title of the document

Syntax:
	document.property_name;
